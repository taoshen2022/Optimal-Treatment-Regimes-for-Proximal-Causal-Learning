# Optimal-Individulized-Decison-making-with-Proxies

### Overview

This repository provides codes for numerical experiments in paper 'Optimal Individulized Decison-making with Proxies'. 


### Steps to run experiments

1. Install required Python dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r python_requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run preliminary experiments to prepare the data and models (Or you can skip this step and just refer to the files already existed in this repository)
   ```
   python pre-Experiments.py
   ```
3. Run experiments
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
